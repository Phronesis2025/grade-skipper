# GradeSkipper Comprehensive PRD
**Version:** 3.1  
**Date:** April 22, 2025  
**Author:** Grok 3 (xAI)  
**Purpose:** Provide a detailed, unified specification for the GradeSkipper application, an educational platform designed to help students assess knowledge, practice skills, and unlock achievements through interactive quizzes. This document consolidates requirements from prior PRDs, user flows, and clarifying questions, covering the homepage, grade-level selection page, quiz page, results page, and supporting features like OpenAI integration, storage, and achievements.

## 1. Project Overview
GradeSkipper is a Next.js-based educational platform aimed at helping students advance their studies through interactive quizzes and progress tracking. The app allows users to select subjects and grade levels, take quizzes with immediate feedback, review results, and track their learning progress. Key features include:

- **User Journey:** From the homepage, users select a subject, choose a grade level, take a quiz, review results, and return to the homepage with updated stats.
- **Quiz Generation:** Questions are generated dynamically using the OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo), with caching to optimize performance.
- **Progress Tracking:** Stats, achievements, and subject progress are persisted (TBD: Supabase vs. local storage).
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive with accessibility features like keyboard navigation and large touch targets.

The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling, Lucide Icons for visual elements, and TypeScript for type safety, ensuring a clean, modern, and maintainable codebase.

Detailed in Section 2.4.

### 3.4 Results Page
Detailed in Section 2.5.

### 3.5 Data and Content
**Question Source:**
- All quiz questions, answers, hints, and explanations are generated by OpenAI.
- On "Start Quiz" click, an API call generates 10 grade-level questions (5 for Coding & AI) for the selected subject, including 4 multiple-choice answers (or 2 for True/False), a topic tag, a hint, and detailed explanations for both correct and incorrect answers. Incorrect explanations are specific to each option (e.g., { "A": "...", "B": "...", "C": "...", "D": "..." }).
- The OpenAI API call is optimized with in-memory caching (app/api/questions/route.ts) and a lower temperature setting (0.4) to reduce generation time.
- **TBD:** Discuss setting up a database to store questions and related data.

**Question Format:**
- Questions are either multiple choice (4 options) or True/False.
- For Reading subject questions tagged as "Comprehension" or referring to a passage (e.g., "What is the main idea of the passage?"), OpenAI generates a short passage (3-5 sentences) included in the response as a `passage` field.

**Correct Answers:**
- OpenAI provides the correct answer as a letter (A, B, C, D for multiple choice; A, B for True/False).
- During the quiz, questions and answers are stored in memory (useState) in app/subject/[id]/quiz/[grade]/page.tsx.
- Post-completion, results are saved to Supabase (TBD: finalize schema).

**Randomization:**
- Questions are randomized in order for each quiz.

**Subject-Specific Content:**
- Questions cover a mix of topics pertinent to the subject, each tagged with a topic (e.g., Fractions).
- Tags are used to track focus areas for improvement.

### 3.6 User Interactions
**Answer Selection:**
- Users select answers via radio buttons, with a blue shaded background (#E0E7FF) on selection.
- Users can change their selection before submitting.
- The "Submit Answer" button is disabled until an answer is selected.
- No "Previous" button; users cannot skip questions and must answer sequentially.

**Navigation:**
- **Submit Answer:** See Section 2.4 for actions post-submission.
- No retry for incorrect answers.
- After the last question, navigates to the results page.

**Tools:**
- **Hint:** Displays a static text hint (e.g., “Divide numerator and denominator by their GCD”), generated by OpenAI.
- **Calculator:** Opens a simple modal with basic operations (+, -, *, /), shown for Mathematics and Science, hidden for Reading, History, English, Coding & AI, Logic Puzzles. Implementation TBD (search for a free React calculator component like react-simple-calculator).
- **Notes:** Not needed, removed.

**Progress Bar:**
- Shows progress through the 10 questions (e.g., 50% at question 6/10).

### 3.7 Progress Tracking and Integration
**Homepage Stats:**
- **Order:**
  - Total Quiz Score %: Correct answers ÷ total questions across all quizzes.
  - Quizzes Completed: Increment by 1 for each quiz completed.
  - Current Streak/Longest Streak: Increment daily (e.g., streak becomes 2 if a quiz is taken today). Reset on missed days. "Current Streak" title switches to "Longest Streak" with max days; switches back to "Current Streak" when surpassing the previous best.
  - Achievements: Display the number of earned achievements.
- **Subject Progress:**
  - Users must achieve 90%+ on 5 grade-level quizzes per subject to achieve mastery.
  - Mastery unlocks the next grade level.
  - Progress capped at 100% per grade level per subject.
  - Progress is stored for continued learning.
- **Points:**
  - +1 point per correct answer.
  - +10 points per quiz with 90%+ score.
  - +25 points per achievement earned.

**Storage:**
- TBD: Finalize Supabase vs. local storage. Supabase is preferred for persistent data across devices (free tier available). Temporary storage during the quiz uses React state (useState) in app/subject/[id]/quiz/[grade]/page.tsx.

### 3.8 Visual and Behavioral Feedback
**Correct/Incorrect Feedback:**
- After submitting each question:
  - **Correct Answer:** Green check mark next to the selected answer, with a detailed explanation (e.g., "Great job! You recognized that 0.75 is the same as 75/100, which simplifies to 3/4. Keep practicing converting decimals to fractions!").
  - **Incorrect Answer:** Red X next to the selected answer, green check next to the correct answer, with a detailed explanation specific to the user’s selection (e.g., "Option D (2/3) is incorrect. When you divide 2 by 3, you get approximately 0.666, which is less than 0.75. To convert 0.75 to a fraction, recognize that 0.75 = 75/100, which simplifies to 3/4, so the correct answer is option A."). Fixed to ensure specific `explanations.incorrect` from OpenAI or fallback questions are used, rather than default messages (e.g., "The Golgi Apparatus is responsible for packaging and distributing proteins, not energy production" for a Science question).
- Explanation appears below Hint and Calculator buttons, styled to match the page (text-[14px] text-[#333], white background, padding: 10px, border-radius: 6px).

**Passage Display (Reading Comprehension):**
- For Reading subject questions tagged as "Comprehension" or referring to a passage (e.g., "What is the main idea of the passage?"), a passage (3-5 sentences) is displayed above the question (text-[16px] text-[#333], p-[10px], bg-[#F5F5F5], rounded-[6px]). Passages are omitted for non-comprehension questions (e.g., Vocabulary, True/False).

**Error Handling:**
- "Submit Answer" button disabled until an answer is selected.
- "No quiz available" shown if no data for the subject (e.g., OpenAI API call fails), with "Retry" and "Back to [Subject]" buttons.

**Loading State:**
- Replaced with a custom `LoadingAnimation` component (components/LoadingAnimation.tsx), showing an animated book, flipping page, and pencil with cycling messages (e.g., "Loading Knowledge", "Preparing Lessons", "Getting Ready", "Almost There", updated every 3 seconds). The animation is centered in the question card area during OpenAI calls (>2 seconds). Accessibility: Includes `aria-live="polite"` for screen reader updates and a `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable animations for users who prefer reduced motion.

**Completion Feedback:**
- After quiz completion, users navigate to the results page to view their score and review questions.

### 3.9 Edge Cases and Constraints

  }
Requirements:
Generate exactly 10 questions (5 for Coding & AI).
Questions must suit [grade]th-grade level.
For the Reading subject, if the topic is "Comprehension" or the question refers to a passage (e.g., "What is the main idea of the passage?"), include a "passage" field with a short passage (3-5 sentences) that the question is based on.
For non-comprehension questions (e.g., Vocabulary or true/false), omit the "passage" field.
Options must have either 2 options (true/false) or 4 options (multiple-choice).
correctAnswer must be a letter (A, B, C, or D), not a numerical value.
Ensure accuracy and variety in topics.
Use proper grammar in questions.
For each incorrect option in explanations.incorrect, provide specific feedback explaining why that option is wrong.
Return the questions as a JSON array: [{"topic": "...", "passage": "...", "question": "...", ...}, ...]"
Output Example:

  {
    "topic": "Comprehension",
    "passage": "Recycling is an important way to help protect our planet. Every day, we throw away items like plastic bottles, paper, and glass, but these can often be reused or turned into new products. By recycling, we reduce waste in landfills and save natural resources like trees and water.",
    "question": "What is the main idea of the passage?",
    "options": ["A) The importance of recycling", "B) How to bake a cake", "C) Benefits of exercise", "D) History of computers"],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "hint": "Think about the overall message the passage is trying to convey.",
    "explanation": "The passage discusses how recycling helps protect the planet by reducing waste and saving resources, making the main idea the importance of recycling.",
    "explanations": {
      "correct": "Great job! The passage focuses on how recycling helps the environment, which matches option A.",
      "incorrect": {
        "B": "How to bake a cake is incorrect because the passage is about recycling, not baking.",
        "C": "Benefits of exercise is incorrect because the passage does not discuss exercise.",
        "D": "History of computers is incorrect because the passage is about environmental protection, not technology."
      }

    "explanation": "To simplify 24/32, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 24 and 32, which is 8. Divide both by 8: 24 ÷ 8 = 3, 32 ÷ 8 = 4, so 24/32 = 3/4.",
    "explanations": {
      "correct": "Great job! You simplified 24/32 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD, 8: 24 ÷ 8 = 3, 32 ÷ 8 = 4, so the answer is 3/4. Keep practicing simplifying fractions!",
      "incorrect": {
        "B": "Option B (4/3) is incorrect because this would be the result of inverting the fraction instead of simplifying. To simplify, divide both 24 and 32 by their GCD, 8: 24 ÷ 8 = 3, 32 ÷ 8 = 4, so the correct answer is 3/4 (option A).",
        "C": "Option C (2/3) is incorrect. You might have divided the numerator and denominator by different numbers. The correct GCD of 24 and 32 is 8: 24 ÷ 8 = 3, 32 ÷ 8 = 4, so the answer is 3/4 (option A).",
        "D": "Option D (5/8) is incorrect. This might come from a miscalculation of the GCD. The correct GCD of 24 and 32 is 8: 24 ÷ 8 = 3, 32 ÷ 8 = 4, so the answer is 3/4 (option A)."
      }
    }
  }
]
Validation:

Ensure 10 questions (5 for Coding & AI), valid options, non-empty fields; retry API call if invalid.
Validate correctAnswer is a letter (A, B, C, D for multiple choice; A, B for True/False).
Validate explanations.incorrect contains entries for all incorrect options.
Error Handling:

Timeout after 30 seconds, show "No quiz available" with "Retry" and "Back to [Subject]" buttons.
Rate limit fallback: TBD (e.g., static mock questions).
Response Time:

Show custom LoadingAnimation component (components/LoadingAnimation.tsx) with an animated book, flipping page, and pencil, with cycling messages (e.g., "Loading Knowledge", "Preparing Lessons") for >2 seconds.
Optimized with in-memory caching (app/api/questions/route.ts) and temperature: 0.4 (target: <5 seconds for first request, near-instant for cached requests).
Suggestions:

GPT-3.5-turbo is sufficient, but GPT-4o-mini could be evaluated for efficiency/cost if budget allows (TBD).
4.3 Storage
Preferred Option: Supabase for server-side storage (free tier available, seamless with Next.js via @supabase/supabase-js).

Pros:

Persistent user data (progress, scores, achievements) across devices.
Scalable for future features (e.g., accounts, leaderboards).
Free tier supports small-scale apps (500MB database, 1GB file storage).
Cons:

Setup complexity vs. local storage.
Requires authentication for user-specific data (TBD: anonymous or email-based).
Temporary Storage:

During quiz: Store OpenAI questions/answers in memory (useState) in app/subject/[id]/quiz/[grade]/page.tsx for validation and results.
Post-completion: Save to Supabase (TBD: table schema, e.g., users, quizzes, achievements).
Fallback: If Supabase setup is deferred, use lib/storage.ts (local storage) to store:

completedQuizzes: Array of { subject, grade, score, timestamp }.
subjectProgress: { [subject]: { [grade]: { quizScores: number[], mastered: boolean } } }.
points: Number.
streaks: { current: number, longest: number, lastQuizDate: string }.
achievements: Array of { id, name, earned }.
TBD:

Finalize Supabase vs. local storage (no changes made; still pending).
Schema for quiz results, progress, achievements.
Storage limits (e.g., cap quiz history to 100 entries).
4.4 Calculator Tool
Implementation: TBD (search for a free, pre-built React calculator component like react-simple-calculator or build custom).

Features:

Modal (bg-white, rounded-lg, p-[20px], shadow-[0_4px_8px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1)]).
Buttons for digits (0-9), operations (+, -, *, /), equals, clear (bg-[#4361ee], text-[white], rounded-[4px]).
Display for input/result (text-[18px] text-[#333]).
Availability: Show button for Mathematics, Science; hide for Reading, History, English, Coding & AI, Logic Puzzles (based on subject ID).
Behavior: Opens on click, closes via "Close" button or outside click, no tracking.

4.5 Achievements System
Achievements:

Correct Answers in a Row:
"5 in a Row" (5 correct, resets on incorrect).
"10 in a Row" (10 correct, resets on incorrect).
Mastery:
Per subject/grade (e.g., "6th Grade Math Master", 90%+ on 5 quizzes).
Per grade level (e.g., "6th Grade Scholar", master all subjects).
Streak: "Streak Breaker" each time the longest streak is surpassed.
Display: Pop-up on earning (bg-white, rounded-lg, p-[20px], text-[16px] text-[#333], "Achievement Unlocked: X!"), TBD: confetti animation.

Storage: TBD (Supabase table or local storage array).

Additional Ideas:

"Quiz Master": Complete 10 quizzes (any subject/grade).
"Quick Learner": Finish a quiz in <5 minutes.
"Hint Avoider": Complete a quiz without using hints.
"Perfect Score": Score 100% on a quiz.
"Subject Specialist": Master 3 grade levels in one subject.
"Diverse Scholar": Complete a quiz in every subject.
"Persistent Student": Take quizzes on 7 consecutive days.
"Big Points": Earn 1000 points.
"Early Bird": Complete a quiz before 8 AM.
"Topic Expert": Answer 10 questions correctly in one topic (e.g., Fractions).
4.6 Accessibility
Keyboard Navigation: Tab through radio buttons, "Submit Answer", "Next Question", "Back to [Subject]", Enter to select/submit.
Touch Targets: Minimum 48x48px for radio buttons, buttons on mobile.
No Horizontal Scrolling: Wrap explanations, stack elements vertically.
Loading Animation Accessibility: Custom LoadingAnimation component includes aria-live="polite" for screen reader updates and a prefers-reduced-motion media query to disable animations for users who prefer reduced motion.
TBD: ARIA labels, screen reader support, high-contrast mode.
4.7 Mobile Behavior
Responsive Design:

Radio buttons stack vertically (flex-direction: column, gap: 8px) below 640px.
Buttons full-width (width: 100%) on mobile.
Progress bar container stacks vertically (flex-direction: column) below 640px.
Touch Targets: Large buttons (min-height: 48px) for easy tapping.
Layout: Centered card adjusts to screen width (padding: 15px below 640px).
4.8 Performance
OpenAI Calls: Debounce to avoid duplicate requests (implemented with useRef in app/subject/[id]/quiz/[grade]/page.tsx), cache in memory (app/api/questions/route.ts) to reuse questions for "Retake Quiz".
Rendering: Optimize with React useMemo for question rendering, lazy-load calculator modal.
TBD: Rate limit handling (e.g., static fallback questions if Supabase unavailable).
5. Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability: Support 100 concurrent users with OpenAI API and Supabase free tier.
Availability: 99% uptime, assuming OpenAI and Supabase reliability.
Security:
Store OpenAI API key in .env.local (OPENAI_API_KEY).
Validate user input (radio selections) client-side.
TBD: Supabase authentication for user-specific data.
Compatibility: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge; iOS/Android mobile browsers.
Performance: Page load <2 seconds, quiz generation <5 seconds (or error), cached requests near-instant.
Maintainability: Modular components (QuizCard, ProgressBar), clear file structure, TypeScript for type safety.
6. Assumptions and TBD Items
Assumptions:

OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo is sufficient for question generation; GPT-4o-mini evaluation TBD.
Supabase free tier meets storage needs for the initial launch.
Homepage’s subjects array (app/page.tsx) is reused for subject data (name, icon, color).
"Back to Home"/"Back to [Subject]" discards quiz data without confirmation unless on the results page.
Calculator modal is simple (no scientific functions), styled to match the #4361ee theme.
Achievements pop-up closes automatically after 3 seconds (TBD: user interaction).
Temporary padding adjustment (p-[10px]) to be revisited in Phase 4 for alignment with PRD’s p-[25px] or subject card styles.
TBD Items:

Finalize Supabase vs. local storage (lib/storage.ts):
Schema for completedQuizzes, subjectProgress, points, streaks, achievements.
Authentication (anonymous or email-based).
OpenAI API model (GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4o-mini) and cost optimization.
Exact calculator component (search for react-simple-calculator or custom build).
Rate limit handling for OpenAI (e.g., mock questions as fallback).
Detailed accessibility (ARIA, screen reader support) if prioritized later.
Storage limits for quiz history (e.g., cap at 100 quizzes).
Homepage stat update mechanism (client-side state vs. reload).
Dynamic routing structure (e.g., app/subject/[id]/quiz/[grade]/page.tsx vs. query params).
7. Success Criteria
Usability: Users complete a quiz in <10 minutes, find feedback clear (green/red markers, detailed explanations).
Engagement: 80% of users retake a quiz or try another subject after results.
Accuracy: Homepage stats (score %, quizzes, streak, achievements) reflect quiz performance with 100% accuracy.
Performance: Quiz loads in <5 seconds (cached requests near-instant), including OpenAI call, with spinner for >2 seconds.
Consistency: Design matches index.html (white card, bg-[#4361ee] buttons, #F9FAFB background for most pages, #F0F1F2 for results page) across desktop/mobile.
Progression: Users unlock 7th-grade quizzes after mastering 6th-grade, progress persists across sessions.
8. Risks and Mitigations
Risk: OpenAI API rate limits or timeouts.
Mitigation: Implement retry button, 30-second timeout, TBD fallback questions.
Risk: Supabase setup delays or free tier limits.
Mitigation: Fallback to local storage (lib/storage.ts), defer authentication.
Risk: Inconsistent OpenAI question quality.
Mitigation: Strict prompt structure, validate JSON output, retry if invalid. Fixed to ensure passages are generated for Reading comprehension questions (e.g., "What is the main idea of the passage?") and specific incorrect explanations are used (e.g., "The Golgi Apparatus is responsible for packaging and distributing proteins, not energy production" in Science quizzes).
Risk: Mobile usability issues (small touch targets).
Mitigation: Ensure 48x48px targets, test on iOS/Android browsers.
Risk: Progress loss if storage fails.
Mitigation: Save to Supabase/local storage after each quiz, validate data integrity.
9. Development Plan
Phase 1: Grade-Level Selection Page (Static)

Goal: Build app/subject/[id]/page.tsx with static grade options.

Tasks:

Create grade selection page: White card, radio buttons (6th-9th, 6th enabled, others disabled with tooltips), "Start Quiz" button, "Back to Home" button (bg-[#4361ee], text-[white], top-right).
Use static subject data from app/page.tsx (subjects array).
Style to match index.html (#F9FAFB, rounded-[10px], p-[10px] temporary). Deliverables: Static page.tsx, reusable components (RadioButtonGroup).
Status: Completed.
Phase 2: Quiz Page (Static)

Goal: Build app/subject/[id]/quiz/[grade]/page.tsx with static questions.

Tasks:

Implement quiz page: Subject title, topic sub-header, progress bar, question card (radio buttons, "Submit Answer"), hint/calculator, feedback area.
Use mock data from lib/questions/mathematics.ts (10 questions, 4 options or true/false, hints, explanations).
Add "Back to [Subject]" button (bg-[#4361ee], text-[white], top-right), loading spinner, error state.
Style to match index.html. Deliverables: page.tsx, QuizCard.tsx, ProgressBar.tsx, CalculatorModal.tsx.
Status: Completed.
Phase 3: Results Page (Static)

Goal: Build app/subject/[id]/results/page.tsx with static results.

Tasks:

Create results page: Score display (e.g., "8/10 (80%)"), accordion with static questions/answers, navigation buttons ("Return to Home", "Take Another Quiz", "Retake Quiz").
Use mock data (e.g., 10 Mathematics questions, 80% score).
Add "Back to Home" button (bg-[#4361ee], text-[white], top-right).
Style to match index.html. Deliverables: page.tsx, Accordion.tsx.
Status: Completed.
Phase 4: OpenAI API Integration and Storage

Goal: Replace static questions with OpenAI-generated content, persist progress.

Tasks:

Create app/api/questions/route.ts with API route for OpenAI question generation, including in-memory caching and validation.
Integrate API call on "Start Quiz" click, show spinner, handle errors.
Validate JSON response, store questions in memory for quiz and results.
Setup Supabase (or extend lib/storage.ts for local storage).
Save quiz results (completedQuizzes, subjectProgress, points, streaks, achievements).
Update app/page.tsx stats order, sync with storage.
Revisit padding (p-[10px] vs. p-[25px] or subject card styles).
Fixed: Ensure specific incorrect explanations are used for Science quizzes (e.g., "The Golgi Apparatus is responsible for packaging and distributing proteins, not energy production").
Fixed: Added passage generation for Reading comprehension questions (e.g., "Recycling is an important way to help protect our planet...").
Added: Custom LoadingAnimation component (components/LoadingAnimation.tsx) to replace the default spinner, showing an animated book, flipping page, and pencil with cycling messages (e.g., "Loading Knowledge", "Preparing Lessons"). Deliverables: app/api/questions/route.ts, Supabase client or updated lib/storage.ts, modified page.tsx files, components/LoadingAnimation.tsx.
Status: OpenAI integration completed (questions generated, cached, validated; passages added for Reading comprehension; specific incorrect explanations fixed for Science quizzes; custom loading animation implemented). Storage setup TBD.
Phase 5: Achievements and Polish

Goal: Implement achievements, refine UX.

Tasks:

Add achievement logic (5/10 correct, mastery, streak breaker), pop-up on earning.
Polish accessibility (keyboard navigation, touch targets).
Test mobile responsiveness, performance. Deliverables: AchievementPopUp.tsx, final bug fixes.
Status: Not started.
Timeline: TBD (estimate 2-3 weeks for Phases 1-5, pending Supabase setup and OpenAI key).

10. Future Features
Results Page: As detailed in Section 2.5.
Adaptive Quizzes: No adaptive functionality now; explore options later.
Analytics: Not planned currently.
