GradeSkipper Project Summary - Updated April 18, 2025
Project Overview
The GradeSkipper project is a Next.js-based educational platform designed to help students advance in their studies through interactive quizzes and progress tracking. The homepage displays a user's learning journey, including stats (e.g., Questions Answered), subject progress (e.g., Mathematics), and recommended next steps. The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Lucide Icons for visual elements, with a clean, responsive layout. The project uses TypeScript for type safety and includes a basic data storage system for user progress.

Project Structure
The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure:

app/page.tsx: The main homepage component, displaying learning journey, subjects, and recommended next steps.
app/layout.tsx: The root layout with a sticky Navbar component that scrolls to the top on navigation.
app/subject/[id]/page.tsx: Grade-level selection page for a specific subject, allowing users to select a grade and start a quiz.
app/subject/[id]/quiz/[grade]/page.tsx: Quiz page for a specific subject and grade level, displaying a question with answer options and navigation.
app/subject/[id]/results/page.tsx: Results page displaying quiz completion stats.
components/layout/Navbar.tsx: Sticky navigation bar showing the app logo ("GradeSkipper" with üéì emoji, #4361ee) and user profile ("Welcome, Amelia!" with amelia.png avatar).
components/CustomLink.tsx: Custom link component for consistent navigation with scroll-to-top behavior on route changes.
app/globals.css: Global styles with Tailwind CSS directives and custom styling.
lib/questions/: Contains question data files for each subject (e.g., mathematics.ts, science.ts), to be used for dynamic data in future phases.
lib/storage.ts: Functions for managing user progress data.
lib/types.ts: TypeScript interfaces for data structures.
public/: Contains static assets including Amelia's profile picture (amelia.png) and subject icons.

Shows a subtitle: ‚ÄúPlease select a grade level to start the quiz‚Äù.
Grade selection radio buttons (6th-9th grades), with 7th-9th disabled and showing tooltips (e.g., ‚ÄúMaster 6th grade to unlock‚Äù).
‚ÄúStart Quiz‚Äù button links to /subject/[id]/quiz/[grade] (e.g., /subject/science/quiz/6).
‚ÄúBack to Home‚Äù button at the top-right, styled as bg-[#4361ee] text-white px-[12px] py-[6px] rounded-[6px] text-[14px] font-semibold, linking to /.
UI Improvements:
Consistent white card styling with shadow.
Adjusted padding/margins to eliminate scrollbar on desktop (total height ~444px, fits within 600px viewport).
Responsive design: Buttons stack on mobile, padding adjusts (max-sm:p-[15px]).
No footer, matching updated design consistency.
4. Quiz Page (Phase 2)
Route: app/subject/[id]/quiz/[grade]/page.tsx (e.g., /subject/science/quiz/6).
Features:
Displays the subject title (e.g., ‚ÄúScience‚Äù) and progress indicator (‚ÄúQuestion 8 of 10‚Äù, 60% progress bar, static data).
Question card with a static question (‚ÄúWhat is the result of simplifying the fraction 24/32?‚Äù) and four answer options as radio buttons (3/4, 4/3, 2/3, 5/8).
State management for answer selection (selectedAnswer).
‚ÄúSubmit Answer‚Äù button links to /subject/[id]/results.
‚ÄúBack to [Subject]‚Äù button at the top-right, styled like the ‚ÄúBack to Home‚Äù button, linking to /subject/[id].
Tools section with ‚ÄúHint‚Äù and ‚ÄúCalculator‚Äù (non-functional, with SVGs).
UI Improvements:
Adjusted padding/margins to eliminate scrollbar on desktop.
Responsive design: Progress bar and buttons stack on mobile (max-sm:flex-col).
Removed footer for consistency with the grade selector page.
Reduced padding between navbar and ‚ÄúBack to [Subject]‚Äù button (pt-[5px]).
5. Results Page (Phase 3)
Route: app/subject/[id]/results/page.tsx (e.g., /subject/science/results).
Features:
Displays the subject title (e.g., ‚ÄúScience‚Äù), ‚ÄúQuiz Completed!‚Äù, static score (‚ÄúScore: 8/10 Correct‚Äù), and percentage (‚Äú80%‚Äù).
‚ÄúTry Again‚Äù button links to /subject/[id]/quiz/[grade] (hardcoded as grade ‚Äú6‚Äù for now).
‚ÄúBack to [Subject]‚Äù button inside the card, linking to /subject/[id].
‚ÄúBack to Home‚Äù button at the top-right, styled like previous back buttons, linking to / (homepage).
UI Improvements:
Consistent white card styling with shadow.
Responsive design: Buttons stack on mobile (max-sm:flex-col).
No footer, matching the grade selector and quiz pages.
No scrollbar on desktop (content fits within viewport).
6. Navigation and Responsiveness
Navbar: Sticky across all pages, scrolls to the top on route changes (implemented via app/layout.tsx).
CustomLink: Ensures scroll-to-top behavior on all navigation.
Responsive Design:
All pages adjust padding, stack elements (e.g., buttons, progress bars) on mobile (max-sm: breakpoints).
Consistent spacing and centering across viewport widths.
7. Code Quality Improvements
Used inline styles where needed to overcome CSS specificity issues.
Standardized spacing and sizing values across components.
Implemented proper centering techniques for icons and content.
Maintained consistent styling patterns (white cards, #F9FAFB background, #4361ee buttons).
Used Tailwind‚Äôs bracket notation for consistent color application (e.g., text-[white]).
Improved component structure with appropriate nesting and logical grouping.
Current State
The GradeSkipper app now has a fully functional user journey: users can select a subject and grade level, take a quiz, and view their results. The UI is consistent across all pages, with white cards, subtle shadows, and a cohesive design language. The navbar is sticky, navigation scrolls to the top on route changes, and all pages are responsive with no scrollbars on desktop. Static data is used for quiz questions and results (e.g., score of 8/10, 80%), which will be replaced with dynamic data in the next phase. The app is ready to move forward with dynamic data integration and additional functionality.

Next Steps
Implement Dynamic Data (Phase 4):
Replace static quiz questions with data from lib/questions/ (e.g., mathematics.ts, science.ts).
Replace static quiz results (8/10, 80%) with actual user performance data.
Implement functionality to track and store quiz responses in lib/storage.ts.
Add functionality to update subject completion percentages on the homepage.
Subject Detail Pages:
Enhance individual subject pages with additional details (e.g., progress tracking, topic selection).
Ensure consistent styling across all pages.
Quiz Functionality:
Enhance the quiz page with more question types (e.g., multiple choice, true/false).
Implement scoring and progress tracking (e.g., track correct answers, update progress bar).
Add difficulty levels based on grade selection.
User Authentication:
Add user login/profile functionality.
Store progress data per user in lib/storage.ts.
Analytics Dashboard:
Develop the analytics page (app/analytics/page.tsx) to visualize learning progress.
Create charts/graphs to display performance metrics.
Conclusion
The GradeSkipper project has made significant progress with the implementation of the grade-level selection, quiz, and results pages, completing the core user journey. The UI is polished and consistent, with responsive design and no scrollbars on desktop. The app is now ready for dynamic data integration in Phase 4, followed by enhancements to quiz functionality, user authentication, and analytics. The current implementation provides a clean, modern interface that engages students as they learn and advance through various subjects.
