# GradeSkipper Project Summary - Updated April 22, 2025
Project Overview
The GradeSkipper project is a Next.js-based educational platform designed to help students advance their studies through interactive quizzes and progress tracking. The app allows users to select a subject (e.g., Mathematics, Science), choose a grade level (6th to 9th), take a quiz with OpenAI-generated questions, review results, and track their progress on the homepage. Key features include:

Homepage: Displays learning journey stats (Total Quiz Score %, Quizzes Completed, Current/Longest Streak, Achievements), subject progress, and recommended next steps.
Grade-Level Selection: Users choose a grade level for a subject before starting a quiz.
Quiz Page: Presents 10 questions (5 for Coding & AI) with immediate feedback, hints, and a calculator tool for relevant subjects.
Results Page: Shows quiz scores, question reviews via an accordion, and navigation options.
Progress Tracking: Stats, achievements, and subject progress are stored (TBD: Supabase vs. local storage).
Tech Stack: Next.js 13+ (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling, Lucide Icons for visuals.
The app aims for a clean, responsive layout with accessibility features like keyboard navigation and large touch targets.

No footer, matching updated design consistency.
Quiz Page (Phase 2 & Phase 4)
Route: app/subject/[id]/quiz/[grade]/page.tsx (e.g., /subject/science/quiz/6).
Features:
Displays the subject title (e.g., “Science”), grade level (“Grade 6”), and progress bar showing progress (e.g., 50% at question 6/10).
Question card with OpenAI-generated questions (e.g., “What is the result of simplifying the fraction 24/32?”) and four answer options as radio buttons (e.g., 3/4, 4/3, 2/3, 5/8) or two for True/False.
State management for answer selection (selectedAnswer), feedback (correct/incorrect), and question navigation.
“Submit Answer” button validates the answer and shows feedback: green check for correct, red X for incorrect with green check on the correct answer, and a detailed explanation specific to the user’s selection for incorrect answers.
“Next Question” button replaces “Submit Answer” after feedback, navigates to the next question or results page after the last question.
“Back to [Subject]” button at the top-right, styled like the “Back to Home” button, linking to /subject/[id].
Tools section with “Hint” (shows OpenAI-generated hint) and “Calculator” (non-functional modal, hidden for non-relevant subjects like Reading, History).
Loading state: Spinner with “Loading your quiz questions, please wait...” during OpenAI call.
Error state: “No quiz available” with “Retry” and “Back to [Subject]” buttons if OpenAI fails.
UI Improvements:

Results Page (Phase 3)
Route: app/subject/[id]/results/page.tsx (e.g., /subject/science/results).
Features:
Displays the subject title (e.g., “Science”), static score (“Score: 8/10 Correct”), and percentage (“80%”).
Accordion component for question review, showing each question, the user’s answer, the correct answer, and an explanation (if incorrect). Accordion headers are shaded based on correctness: #e6f7e9 (light green) for correct, #ffebee (light red) for incorrect.
“Retake Quiz” button links to /subject/[id]/quiz/[grade] (hardcoded as grade “6” for now), shown only if the score is less than 100%, restarts the same quiz and overwrites the score if higher.
“Back to [Subject]” button inside the card, linking to /subject/[id].
“Back to Home” button at the top-right, styled like previous back buttons, linking to / (homepage).
UI Improvements:
Background updated to #F0F1F2 for a distinct look compared to other pages.
Container width increased to max-w-[800px] for a wider layout.
Consistent white card styling with shadow.
Responsive design: Buttons stack on mobile (max-sm:flex-col).
No footer, matching the grade selector and quiz pages.
No scrollbar on desktop (content fits within viewport).
OpenAI Integration (Phase 4)
Features:
API route (app/api/questions/route.ts) generates 10 questions (5 for Coding & AI) using OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo (temperature: 0.4 for faster generation).
Questions include topic, question text, options, correct answer (as a letter), hint, and detailed explanations (correct and incorrect, with incorrect explanations specific to each option).
In-memory caching implemented to reduce generation time for subsequent requests (first request ~13 seconds, needs optimization; cached requests near-instant).
Validation ensures correct answer format and explanation structure; falls back to lib/questions/mathematics.ts if OpenAI fails.
Loading state with spinner and “Loading your quiz questions, please wait...” message during API call.
Error handling: Timeout after 30 seconds, shows “No quiz available” with “Retry” and “Back to [Subject]” buttons.
Navigation and Responsiveness
Navbar: Sticky across all pages, scrolls to the top on route changes (implemented via app/layout.tsx).
CustomLink: Ensures scroll-to-top behavior on all navigation.
Responsive Design:
All pages adjust padding, stack elements (e.g., buttons, progress bars) on mobile (max-sm: breakpoints).
Consistent spacing and centering across viewport widths.
Accessibility:
Keyboard navigation: Tab through radio buttons, buttons, Enter to select/submit.
Touch targets: Minimum 48x48px.
No horizontal scrolling: Elements stack vertically.
Current State
The GradeSkipper app has a fully functional user journey:

Users can select a subject and grade level, take a quiz with OpenAI-generated questions, and view their results with the ability to review each question via an accordion component.
The quiz page prevents duplicate API calls using useRef, and questions are cached in memory for faster subsequent loads.
Explanations for incorrect answers are now specific to the user’s selected option, improving feedback quality.
Challenges:

The initial OpenAI question generation takes ~13 seconds, which needs optimization (target: <5 seconds for first request, near-instant for cached requests).
Storage setup is pending (TBD: Supabase vs. local storage).
Calculator tool implementation is TBD (search for a free React component or build custom).
Achievements system and further accessibility enhancements (e.g., ARIA labels) are not yet implemented.
Next Steps
To continue development, we need to focus on the following tasks:

Optimize OpenAI API Call:
Reduce the initial question generation time from ~13 seconds to under 5 seconds.
Explore options like refining the prompt, adjusting API parameters, or implementing better caching strategies.
Implement Grade-Level Selection Page with Dynamic Data:
Replace static grade selection with dynamic logic based on user progress (e.g., unlocking 7th grade after mastering 6th).
Integrate with storage to track mastery (90%+ on 5 quizzes per subject).
Implement Results Page with Dynamic Data:
Replace static score data (“Score: 8/10 Correct”, “80%”) with dynamic calculations based on quiz answers.
Ensure question review accordion reflects actual user answers and correct answers from the quiz session.
Set Up Storage:
Finalize Supabase vs. local storage decision.
Implement storage for quiz results, progress, points, streaks, and achievements.
Define schema for Supabase (if chosen).
Implement Calculator Tool:
Search for a free React calculator component (e.g., react-simple-calculator) or build a custom modal with basic operations (+, -, *, /).
Achievements System (Phase 5):
Implement logic for achievements (e.g., 5/10 correct in a row, mastery, streak breaker).
Add a pop-up notification for earned achievements.
Polish and Test:
Enhance accessibility (e.g., ARIA labels, screen reader support if prioritized).
Test mobile responsiveness and performance across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge; iOS/Android).
Assistance Needed
I need Grok’s help to complete this project by focusing on the next steps outlined above. Please start by assisting with the following:

Optimizing OpenAI API Call:
Analyze the current implementation in app/api/questions/route.ts and suggest improvements to reduce the initial question generation time to under 5 seconds.
Grade-Level Selection Page:
Update app/subject/[id]/page.tsx to integrate dynamic grade unlocking logic based on user progress.
Provide a sample implementation assuming temporary local storage (lib/storage.ts).
Results Page:
Update app/subject/[id]/results/page.tsx to dynamically calculate and display the quiz score and percentage.
Ensure the accordion reflects actual quiz data (user answers, correct answers, explanations).
