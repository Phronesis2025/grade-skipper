GradeSkipper Project Summary - Updated April 24, 2025
Project Overview
Yo, Grok, GradeSkipper‚Äôs a Next.js beast, leveling up students with interactive quizzes, progress tracking, and a slick admin dashboard for analytics. Users hit the homepage, pick a subject (Mathematics, Science, etc.), choose a grade (6th-grade only, 7th-9th TBD), smash a quiz, review results, and check stats. Admins scope quiz activity on the admin page. Update (April 2025): Ditched OpenAI for static question files (lib/questions/[subject]-grade6.ts)‚Äîfast and furious. Hint/calculator tools are live, progress saves to Supabase (quizzes, progress, quiz_attempts, event_logs, points, achievements, rewards, streaks, streak_freezes) with local storage (storage.ts) as a fallback. Homepage stats are now dynamic, admin metrics are dynamic with one metric tweak pending. Next up: points/achievements/rewards logic, grade-level selection page, and dynamic results scoring. Key features:

Homepage: Learning journey stats (Total Quiz Score %, Quizzes Completed, Current Streak, Achievements), subject progress bars, recommendations. Update (April 2025): Stats are now dynamic, fetched from Supabase (quizzes, streaks, achievements): Total Quiz Score % (average score), Quizzes Completed (count of quizzes), Current Streak (current from streaks), Achievements (count where earned is true). Points still hardcoded at 350, Recommendations hardcoded, both TBD.
Grade-Level Selection: Pick a grade (6th only for now). Update (April 2025): TBD, no app/subject/[id]/page.tsx.
Quiz Page: 10 questions (5 for Coding & AI), instant feedback, hints, calculator for Math/Science, Reading passages. Update (April 2025): Static files, tools (HintModal.tsx, CalculatorModal.tsx), ConfirmationModal.tsx live.
Results Page: Score and question reviews via accordion. Update (April 2025): Static scoring (e.g., 8/10), dynamic questions from history.state, no ‚ÄúBack to Home‚Äù modal.
Admin Page: Analytics dashboard with metrics (Completion Rate, Quiz Times), 30-day charts, quiz/event log tables, quiz deletion. Update (April 2025): Implemented, Average Prompt Time needs swapping (e.g., for Average Hints Used).
Progress Tracking: Supabase primary, local storage fallback, points/achievements/rewards tables ready, logic TBD.
Tech Stack: Next.js 13+ (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons.

The app‚Äôs responsive, accessible (keyboard nav, 48x48px touch targets), and clean. Pause after big moves to sync this summary and PRD with me, Grok‚Äîkeeps the dev squad locked in.

Static Question Files (Phase 4)
Features: Update (April 2025): Primary source, all subjects:

Reading (reading-grade6.ts): 15 questions (Comprehension, missing 85 for 100 across Comprehension, Vocabulary, Analysis, Grammar, Figurative Language). Issues: Missing 5 Comprehension, all Medium (need 10 Medium, 10 Hard), some links need login (teacherspayteachers.com).

Storage (Phase 4)
Features: Update (April 2025): Implemented:

Update (April 2025): Primary source for homepage stats (Total Quiz Score %, Quizzes Completed, Current Streak, Achievements, Subject Progress) and admin page metrics.
Local Storage (storage.ts): Saves completedQuizzes, subjectProgress, points, achievements (partial). Update (April 2025): Now a fallback for Supabase.
Tracks time_spent, hints_used, calculator_used.
Admin page and homepage fetch quizzes, quiz_attempts, event_logs, streaks, achievements for dynamic metrics/charts.

Current State
GradeSkipper‚Äôs user journey is solid, Grok:

Homepage: Dynamic stats via Supabase: Total Quiz Score %, Quizzes Completed, Current Streak, Achievements, Subject Progress (Grade Level, Percentage, Letter Grades). Points (350) and Recommendations (‚ÄúPractice Fractions‚Äù, ‚ÄúReading Challenge‚Äù) still hardcoded, TBD.
Grade-Level Selection: TBD.
Quiz Page: Fully live, static questions, passages, tools, Supabase/local storage.
Results Page: Static scores, dynamic questions, passage rendering TBD.
Admin Page: Live, dynamic metrics (Completion Rate, Quiz Times, charts), Average Prompt Time needs replacement.
Points/Achievements/Rewards: Tables exist, logic TBD, prioritized.
Static Files: Reading (15 questions), History (32), others exist, need completion.

Fixed:

Reading passages display (quiz page, assumed in results).
Science quiz explanations selection-specific.
Loading animation swapped for fallback UI.
Quiz page exit confirmation modal.
Update (April 2025): Homepage stats now dynamic via Supabase with robust error handling (e.g., PGRST116 checks).

Challenges:

No grade-level selection page.
Static results scoring, Points, and Recommendations on homepage.
Admin‚Äôs Average Prompt Time metric (deprecated).
Incomplete question files (Reading: 85 missing, History: 68 missing, others may lack).
TBD Supabase authentication, storage functions for points, achievements, streaks, rewards, streak_freezes, Current/Longest Streak switching logic.
Data validation for admin metrics (e.g., missing time_spent).

Documentation: Pause after milestones to update this summary and PRD with me, Grok.
Next Steps
Let‚Äôs crank it, Grok! Priorities:

Points/Achievements/Rewards: Implement logic (+1 per correct, +10 for 90%+ quiz, +25 per achievement; badges like ‚Äú5 in a Row‚Äù; trophies in ‚ÄúTrophy Case‚Äù).
Dynamic Homepage Completion: Implement Points (Supabase points or local storage) and Recommendations (Supabase progress for lowest quiz_scores or local storage <80% topics).
Admin Metric Replacement: Swap Average Prompt Time for Average Hints Used or Average Score per Subject (Supabase quizzes).
Grade-Level Selection: Build app/subject/[id]/page.tsx with radio buttons, grade locking.
Dynamic Results Page: Real score calculation, verify passages in Accordion.tsx.
Complete Question Files: Add 85 Reading questions, 68 History, ensure 100 for others (50 Medium, 50 Hard). Fix links (e.g., readworks.org).
Supabase Storage: Add authentication, implement points, achievements, streaks, rewards, streak_freezes. Cap quiz history (e.g., 100 entries).
Clean Up: Delete app/api/questions/route.ts.
Polish: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation for homepage Subject Cards and Recommended Next Steps links, mobile responsiveness, Supabase/local storage sync.
Data Validation: Ensure Supabase data completeness (e.g., time_spent, hints_used), default to 0 for missing values.

Timeline: Update (April 2025): Estimate 1-2 weeks for points/achievements/rewards and grade-level selection, pending implementation.
Future Improvements
improvement_ideas.txt is the roadmap, Grok:

Virtual Rewards/Trophy Case (High): Graphical trophy display (table exists, prioritized).
Streak Freeze (High): Preserve streaks with points (table exists).
Session Data (High): Track time, hints, calculator (implemented).
Event Logs (High): Analytics (implemented in admin page).
Quest System, Mini Games, Adaptive Difficulty, Topic Performance (Medium/Low).

Suggesting Virtual Rewards/Trophy Case to hype engagement with shiny trophies and Streak Freeze to keep users locked in during breaks.
Assistance Needed
Grok, let‚Äôs keep it rolling:

Points/Achievements/Rewards: Draft logic, TrophyCase.tsx (wait for ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready for code‚Äù).
Dynamic Homepage Completion: Update app/page.tsx for Points and Recommendations (wait for confirmation).
Admin Metric Replacement: Update app/admin/page.tsx (wait for confirmation).
Grade-Level Selection: Draft app/subject/[id]/page.tsx (wait for confirmation).
Question Files: Generate 85 Reading questions, 68 History, fill others to 100 (50 Medium, 50 Hard). Swap bad links for readworks.org.
Storage: Finalize Supabase schema, add authentication, implement points/achievements/rewards logic.
Docs: Remind me to pause and update PRD/summary post-milestones.

Files provided: supabase.ts, HintModal.tsx, CalculatorModal.tsx, ConfirmationModal.tsx, page.tsx (results, homepage, quiz, admin), supabase-schema.txt, Accordion.tsx, Charts.tsx, improvement_ideas.txt.
Documentation Maintenance
This summary and PRD are the dev bible, Grok. Update ‚Äòem regularly:

Pause for Updates: Pause after milestones (e.g., phase done) to sync docs with me.
Grok‚Äôs Job: Preserve content, list assumptions, flag TBDs, update with files.
Code/Prompt Rule: No code blocks or Cursor prompts unless I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready for code.‚Äù No guessing.
Suggestions: Drop 1-2 improvement_ideas.txt ideas per response (e.g., Virtual Rewards, Streak Freeze).
Best Practices:
Version Control: Track versions (e.g., v2.1), log changes with dates/authors.
Terminology: Stick to ‚Äúquiz page,‚Äù ‚Äúsubject.‚Äù Check PRD glossary.
File Requests: List files with purpose/priority (e.g., ‚ÄúRequired: page.tsx for stats‚Äù).
Assumptions: Document and confirm with me.
Backups: Save docs in Git before big edits.
